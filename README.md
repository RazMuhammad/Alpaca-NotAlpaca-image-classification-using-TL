# Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

## Purpose

This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning techniques applied to MobileNetV2. The notebook, [alpaca_notalpaca_classification_using_TL.ipynb](alpaca_notalpaca_classification_using_TL.ipynb), illustrates how a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model on ImageNet can be fine-tuned for a new task by leveraging its learned features. The objective is to reduce training time and improve model performance when working with limited or domain-specific datasets.

## Outcome

- **Efficient Training:** Leveraging pre-trained weights allows for quicker convergence and reduced computational cost.
- **Enhanced Performance:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained model provides improved accuracy compared to training from scratch.
- **Workflow Demonstration:** The project offers a complete workflow from data preprocessing, model modification, to evaluation.
- **Practical Use Case:** The approach serves as a template for other computer vision projects requiring transfer learning.

Feel free to explore and extend the project as needed.
